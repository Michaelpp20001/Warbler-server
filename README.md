The server is connected to a Mongodb cloud server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'nodemon'

To start the server run nodemon. the server is listening on port 8081. nodemon is used to run the command "node index.js".

nodemon also instantly refreshes the server once any changes are made.

Must have this running to use the Warbler client (front end).
